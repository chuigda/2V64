 --- CAIN AND ABEL ---

(Genesis 4:1-16)

1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:

5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?

7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.

9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.

11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.

14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.

15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

 --- 译文：该隐和亚伯 ---

（创世纪 4:1-16）

1 有一日，那人和他妻子夏娃同房，夏娃就怀孕，生了该隐，便说：“耶和华使我得了一个男子。”

2 又生了该隐的兄弟亚伯。亚伯是牧羊的，该隐是种地的。

3 有一日，该隐拿地里的出产为供物献给耶和华，

4 亚伯也将他羊群中头生的和羊的脂油献上。耶和华看中了亚伯和他的供物，

5 只是看不中该隐和他的供物。该隐就大大地发怒，变了脸色。

6 耶和华对该隐说：“你为什么发怒呢？你为什么变了脸色呢？

7 你若行得好，岂不蒙悦纳？你若行得不好，罪就伏在门前。它必恋慕你，你却要制伏它。”

8 该隐与他兄弟亚伯说话，二人正在田间，该隐起来打他兄弟亚伯，把他杀了。

9 耶和华对该隐说：“你兄弟亚伯在哪里？”他说：“我不知道。我岂是看守我兄弟的吗？”

10 耶和华说：“你作了什么事呢？你兄弟的血有声音从地里向我哀告。

11 地开了口，从你手里接受你兄弟的血，现在你必从这地受咒诅。

12 你种地，地不再给你效力；你必流离飘荡在地上。”

13 该隐对耶和华说：“我的刑罚太重，过于我所能当的。

14 你如今赶逐我离开这地，以致不见你面，我必流离飘荡在地上，凡遇见我的必杀我。”

15 耶和华对他说：“凡杀该隐的，必遭报七倍。”耶和华就给该隐立一个记号，免得人遇见他就杀他。

16 于是该隐离开耶和华的面，去住在伊甸东边的挪得之地。
